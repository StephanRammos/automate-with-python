# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python 

This repository contains my practice solutions, exercises, and projects from the book *Automate the Boring Stuff with Python* by Al Sweigart.

## Folder Structure

Each chapter has its own folder (e.g., `Ch6-strings`, `Ch9 - reading and writing files`) containing Python scripts relevant to that chapter's topics.

## Scaffold Subfolder

Some chapters contain a `scaffold` subfolder. These hold simplified or stripped-down versions of more complex programs from the book. They are intended as learning aids or as starting points to better understand the logic before working on the full project code.

## Example Projects

- `mclip.py`: Multi-Clipboard Automatic Messages
- `bulletPointAdder.py`: Adds `*` bullets to clipboard text line-by-line
- `randomQuizGenerator.py`: Generates randomized quiz and answer key files
